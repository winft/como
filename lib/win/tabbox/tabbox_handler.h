/**
 * The tabbox is a model based view for displaying a list while switching windows.
 * This functionality is mostly referred to as Alt+Tab. TabBox itself does not provide support for
 * switching windows. This has to be done outside of TabBox inside an independent
 * controller.
 *
 * The main entrance point to tabbox is the class tabbox_handler, which has to be subclassed and
 * implemented. The class Tabbox_client, which represents a window client inside tabbox, has to be
 * implemented as well.
 *
 * The behavior of the tabbox is defined by the tabbox_config and has to be set in the
 * tabbox_handler.
 *
 * In order to use the tabbox the tabbox_config has to be set. The model has to be initialized by
 * calling tabbox_handler::create_model(), as the model is undefined when the tabbox is not active.
 * The tabbox is activated by tabbox_handler::show(). Depending on the current set tabbox_config it
 * is possible that the highlight windows effect activated and that the view is not displayed at
 * all. As already mentioned the tabbox does not handle any updating of the selected item. This has
 * to be done by invoking tabbox_handler::set_current_index(). Nevertheless the tabbox_handler
 * provides methods to query for the model index or the next or previous item, for a cursor position
 * or for a given item (that is tabbox_client). By invoking tabbox_handler::hide() the view, the
 * optional highlight windows effect are removed. The model is invalidated immediately. So if it is
 * necessary to retrieve the last selected item this has to be done before calling the hide method.
 *
 * The layout of the tabbox View and the items is completely customizable. Therefore tabbox provides
 * a widget layout_config which includes a live preview (in kcmkwin/kwintabbox). The layout of items
 * can be defined by an xml document. That way the user is able to define own custom layouts. The
 * view itself is made up of two widgets: one to show the complete list and one to show only the
 * selected item. This way it is possible to have a view which shows for example a list containing
 * only small icons and nevertheless show the title of the currently selected client.
