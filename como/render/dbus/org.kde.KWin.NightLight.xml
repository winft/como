    <!--
        Creates an inhibition lock for Night Light.

        You can use this method to temporarily disable Night Light feature.
        After calling this method, the screen color temperature will be set
        back to the neutral temperature (6500K).

        This method returns a cookie that uniquely identifies the inhibition
        request. You must pass the cookie to uninhibit() when you're done.

        Note that the inhibition lock will be released automatically when
        the service, which requested it, is unregistered.

        A client is allowed to hold more than just one inhibition lock.
