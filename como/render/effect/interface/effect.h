/**
 * @short Base class for all KWin effects
 *
 * This is the base class for all effects. By reimplementing virtual methods
 *  of this class, you can customize how the windows are painted.
 *
 * The virtual methods are used for painting and need to be implemented for
 * custom painting.
 *
 * In order to react to state changes (e.g. a window gets closed) the effect
 * should provide slots for the signals emitted by the EffectsHandler.
 *
 * @section Chaining
 * Most methods of this class are called in chain style. This means that when
 *  effects A and B area active then first e.g. A::paintWindow() is called and
 *  then from within that method B::paintWindow() is called (although
 *  indirectly). To achieve this, you need to make sure to call corresponding
 *  method in EffectsHandler class from each such method (using @ref effects
 *  pointer):
 * @code
 *  void MyEffect::postPaintScreen()
 *  {
 *      // Do your own processing here
 *      ...
 *      // Call corresponding EffectsHandler method
 *      effects->postPaintScreen();
 *  }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @section Effectsptr Effects pointer
 * @ref effects pointer points to the global EffectsHandler object that you can
 *  use to interact with the windows.
 *
 * @section painting Painting stages
 * Painting of windows is done in three stages:
 * @li First, the prepaint pass.<br>
 *  Here you can specify how the windows will be painted, e.g. that they will
 *  be translucent and transformed.
 * @li Second, the paint pass.<br>
 *  Here the actual painting takes place. You can change attributes such as
 *  opacity of windows as well as apply transformations to them. You can also
 *  paint something onto the screen yourself.
 * @li Finally, the postpaint pass.<br>
 *  Here you can mark windows, part of windows or even the entire screen for
 *  repainting to create animations.
 *
 * For each stage there are *Screen() and *Window() methods. The window method
 *  is called for every window while the screen method is usually called just
 *  once.
 *
 * @section OpenGL
 * Effects can use OpenGL if EffectsHandler::isOpenGLCompositing() returns @c true.
 * The OpenGL context may not always be current when code inside the effect is
 * executed. The framework ensures that the OpenGL context is current when the Effect
 * gets created, destroyed or reconfigured and during the painting stages. All virtual
 * methods which have the OpenGL context current are documented.
 *
 * If OpenGL code is going to be executed outside the painting stages, e.g. in reaction
 * to a global shortcut, it is the task of the Effect to make the OpenGL context current:
 * @code
 * effects->makeOpenGLContextCurrent();
 * @endcode
 *
 * There is in general no need to call the matching doneCurrent method.
